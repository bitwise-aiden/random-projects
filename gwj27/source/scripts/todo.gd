# player in idle/sleep state
# spawn dwellers on opposite side (entrance to library)
# after a short period of time player regains control
# player now must move books to correct location 
# book must stay at location for x amount of time to be "returned"
# dwellers will walk around, picking up new books, dropping them randomly at incorrect areas
