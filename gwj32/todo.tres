Theme: Seven
Wildcards:
	- Player standing idle helps their progression
	- Failure is just another path to victory
	- Inlcude some RPG mechanics into your game (stats, skills, etc)


Ideas:
	- that one dice game, but with more stats, skills, etc
	- a game with a skill tree and levelling up?????
	- 7 deadly sins???


RPG where your encounters are dice based
	- stats like:
		- strength is physical power / health
		- dexterity is evasion
		- intelligence is spell power / mana
		- luck is increased chance of critical / chance of enemy miss
	- encounters where you roll dice, choose spells, etc


stats system
	- manage stats
		- increase stats with earnt stat points
	- use stats to calculate damage / health / etc when in an encounter
	- experience / levelling
		- each level earns you a stat point
		- base stats increase
	- de-level (Thanks Jakylgamer :D)
		- could occur when you die, requiring respawn
		- could occur when you take damage


Game where you have to either win or lose based on a prompt x times in a row


7 move game where you make a max of 7 moves to get to the end
 - There are things within the game that can move you
	- block pushes forward every x moves


face past action RPG
	- Every time you finish a room you roll a dice to gain a stat point
	- Every time you get hit you roll a dice to lose a stat point
	- rogue like
		- rooms where you are locked in the room until everything is dead (maybe?)
