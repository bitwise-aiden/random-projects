# Make a game based on the theme of 
# Theme: Alternate Perspectives
# - From: https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-186
# - Use inspiration from: https://waynetron.itch.io/bad-skeleton-and-the-time-police
#
# We want the ability to stack time events on top of each other
# Play forward / backward movement, etc

# Store buffer for each run
# Use Time / PhysicsTime to rewind/replay

# Puzzle game / similar to cave / ice puzzles in Pokemon but you can die
# - Aim to get through puzzle
# - If you die you become ghost version of yourself
#	- Puzzle becomes different and you have to get back to your body to revive

# You move through maze, avoiding killing things
# 	- If you die, you have to reach the safe point before your death to revive
# There could be some falling things that mean you should move faster to prevent
#	exploiting time by standing in place to start with
# Also timer??? Speed run???

# Stretch: Save multiple people. Once saved, start again, save someone else. Previous still occurs


# At time, direction changed to Vector2
	# normalized vector or zero
